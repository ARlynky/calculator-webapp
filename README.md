## About

this project is for me to learn basic full stack stuff.
i learned how to use basic vue and flask and well development in general.

so again, this is not really for public use or anything like that, just me learning.
i made it public repo for the purposes of learning to manage a public repo.

## Install and Use

if you did want to use this you can clone this repo, and run pipeline.sh
in the dir created.
